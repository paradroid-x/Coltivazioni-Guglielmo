# Coltivazioni Guglielmo
Project for my web developing course at Unimi

Website made all by me (front-end & back-end) for a agricultural holding near my hometown.
There's not much to say about it, only that it uses nodejs (url, fs, http) to run the server and to manage the JSON db that holds all of the data about the products that the holding sell.

I plan to improve it by adding some web-workers to help the data transfers, especially the photos and maybe a ordering system; still it looks pretty good for now and hopefully it doesn't have any major weakness.
